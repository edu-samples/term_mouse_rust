# Term Mouse Crossterm

This repository contains example applications demonstrating how to use mouse interactions in terminal-based Rust applications. These examples utilize the `crossterm` crate to capture and handle mouse events.

## Running Examples

To run an example, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --example [example_name]
```

Replace `[example_name]` with the name of the example you wish to run.

## Running Examples with Helper Script

You can also run the examples using the helper script provided in this repository. This script allows you to select and run examples interactively. Use the following command:

```bash
./cargo-example-select --loop --clear
```
